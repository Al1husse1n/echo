f# Echo 🌌  
Your future self — already waiting to talk to you.

> “The contract between Present-You and Future-You.”

Echo is a private AI space where you speak with a version of yourself years from now.  
Not a todo app. Not a coach yelling at you.  
Just a quiet, honest mirror — grounded in who you said you wanted to become.

## The real difference

| Most productivity tools                  | Echo                                      |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Obsessed with the next action            | Obsessed with the person you're becoming  |
| Reminds you what you haven't done        | Reminds you who you said you would be     |
| Creates pressure & guilt                 | Creates clarity & alignment               |
| Lives in calendars and lists             | Lives in values, identity, long-term meaning |

## What Echo actually does

- Lets you define your **FutureProfile**  
  → target year, core identity, values, deepest reasons

- Builds **phased roadmaps** through the Builder Agent  
  → realistic phases, never turning your life into a Jira board

- Speaks to you as your **Future Self**  
  → perspective only, never step-by-step recipes or commands

- Remembers everything through conversation history + RAG  
  → every value you shared, every reflection, stays in context

- Adapts to your chosen tone  
  → Gentle · Brutally honest · Minimal · Motivational

- Sends gentle inactivity nudges  
  → no shame, just a quiet “are we still on the same page?”

## Tech (straightforward & modern)

- **Backend** — Django 5.x · Python 3.11+  
- **AI** — Google Gemini + LangChain  
- **Frontend** — Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS + glassmorphism  
- **Database** — PostgreSQL (SQLite for local dev)  
- **Deployment** — Docker · Gunicorn · Nginx

                                        They’re found in the values you wrote down when you still believed.”
